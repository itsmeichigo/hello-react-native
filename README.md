Projects I worked on while learning React Native

## Installation

* Navigate to each project and run `npm install` first to set up necessary packages.
* Run in iOS or Android simulator / device by opening respective projects
* Or if you have installed `react-native-cli`, run `react-native run-ios` or `react-native run-android`.

## Projects
#### Albums

A simple project built with the basics of React Native, to load a list of information for different albums - fetched from a remote api.

#### Auth

A simple login form to let user authenticate with a system via Firebase.

#### Tech Stack

A more performant list of information, toggled when tapping each cell and made *a bit* fancy with a little touch of animation. Built with redux.

#### Manager

More realistic app built with redux, navigation and modals.
